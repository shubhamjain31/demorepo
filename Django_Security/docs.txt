What is SQL Injection?
SQL injection is a type of attack where a malicious user is able to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database.

In Django:-
a) We use Django ORM
b) In-build Queryset APIs


Exceptions:
a) raw()
b) extra()
c) direct SQL Queries without Django ORM

raw() and extra() is used to execute complex queries

Use Django ORM as much as possible
If using raw(), extra() or Direct SQL Queries
a) Query Parameterization
b) Do not use single quotes around %s
