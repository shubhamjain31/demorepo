Signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place.

Actions :

model's save() method is called.
	django.db.models.signals.pre_save | post_save

model's delete() method is called.
	django.db.models.signals.pre_delete | post_delete

ManyToManyField on a model is changed.
	django.db.models.signals.m2m_changed

Django starts or finishes an HTTP request.
	django.core.signals.request_started | request_finished

All signals are django.dispatch.Signal instances.
